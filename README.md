# aircraft-traffic-control-system
aircraft traffic control system which manages EnQueue,DeQueue and Displaying

1) We can run AtcsApplication.java as a java main application it get started success fully and runs on embeded tomcat port 8081
2)use the url http://localhost:8081/ it displays index.jsp
3)index page contains Add, Delete, DisplayAircrafts, use these links to enqueue/dequeue/display and corresponding form validations.
  Home link on each corresponding page.
  
We can use Database in this app while system is shut downing and system is up (we can add two UI buttons in index page (we can enable and disable) and can implement functionality)

We can use external Server and Database as Spring provdes just configuration.

Please let me know if you need any clarifications.
